AutoMapper

I made this automapper while using EF and ASP.NET MVC. I needed to map from EF autogenerated models to view models which had most of the properties the same name and type, but it can also be used with any other frameworks as well.

For example, you have a "Client" EF model and a "ClientViewModel" and you need an IQueryable of type "ClientViewModel". Then you can use it like this:

```
public class Client
{
  public int Id { get; set; }
  
  public string FirstName { get; set; }
  
  public string LastName { get; set; }
}

public class ClientViewModel : Client
{
  public string FullName { get; set; }
}

public class TestMapper
{
  public static readonly Expression<Func<Client, ClientViewModel>> Map_Client_ClientViewModel =
    ReflectionHelper.ExpressionMapper<Client, ClientViewModel>
    (
      x => new ClientViewModel()
      {
        FullName = x.FirstName + " " x.LastName;
      }
    );
  
  public void TestFunction()
  {
    using (var context = new DbContext())
    {
      var myQuery = context.Clients.Select(Map_Client_ClientViewModel).Where(x => x.FullName == "Some Thing");
    }
  }
}
```

It also has a debug mode, that tells you exaclty what property failed to initialise. In the above example, if "FirstName" is null, then it will tell you that it failed to initialise the "FullName" property. Also, you can specify which properties that you dont want to map. For this, you can use GetPropertyName instead of writing the property name as a string, to prevent runtime errors when renaming properties.

```
string firstNamePropertyName = ReflectionHelper.GetPropertyName<Client>(x => x.FirstName);// "FirstName"
```
